Initialize profit to 0 and mini to the first price in the array.
Iterate through each price starting from the second day.
For each price, calculate the profit if you bought at the minimum price seen so far (mini) and sold today. Update profit if this is the maximum seen so far.
Update mini with the minimum of itself or the current price.
Return profit, which will contain the maximum profit found.

class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int profit = 0;
        int mini = prices[0];

        for(int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            profit = Math.max(profit, prices[i] - mini);
            mini = Math.min(mini, prices[i]);
        }
        return profit;
    }
}
