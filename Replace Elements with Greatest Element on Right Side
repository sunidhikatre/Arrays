Initialize a result array, res, to store the transformed elements. Set the last element in res to -1, as there are no elements to the right of the last element.
Keep track of the maximum value to the right of each element with a variable maxi, starting from the last element.
Traverse the array from the second-last element to the beginning:
Set res[i] to maxi, as maxi is the greatest element to the right of i.
Update maxi to be the maximum of the current maxi and the current element arr[i].
Return res as the transformed array.

class Solution {
    public int[] replaceElements(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int[] res = new int[n];
        res[n-1] = -1;
        int maxi = arr[n-1];

        for(int i = n-2; i>= 0; i--){
            res[i] = maxi;
            maxi = Math.max(maxi, arr[i]);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
